# Driver Finder

App developed to link companies and local drivers.

![Front-Page](/front-page.png)
After reading some news about the shortage of truck drivers in the U.K., I decided to build this app to so companies can find local drivers that can deliver goods and reduce the shortage problem.

Companies can deliver their goods with no delays and might save money hiring the drivers from the app.

Drivers can make some money while doing some daily route, travelers can also earn during their trips.

## Getting started

Download the drivers-finder app containing both server and client folders, run npm install to install all the dependencies and the app is ready!

## Tech stack

Frontend --> I used react-create-app as the frontend framework, using JavaScript, styling with CSS.
Backend --> For the backend, I used expressJS for my server with MongoDB and Mongoose for the database.

### About the experience

This is my first full-stack project, that I did for Codeworks' solo project in Nov/2021. I had one week to develop it, at first seemed really complicated to do everything by myself, but after the planning time I could see clearer what I had to do and how I'd do it.

I used excalidraw to plan all the app's interface, after that I already could see all the components, forms and the data flow that I needed for it. I also used the free database design to organize my initial schema for the project.
